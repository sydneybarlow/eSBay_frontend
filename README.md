eSBay is a project that I built in one week using React.js for the front-end.

eSBay is a mock version of the more widely known eBay - the bartering platform for second hand items.

In this version, you can create a listing and then see that listing posted inside the lists of all of the other items.

When you see the listing, there is a button that says 'Buy'. When you press that button the item is then removed from the list of potential purchases.

You can also update the information about the listing as well. If you want to change the cost or description of the item - you can with the 'Update' button.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

eSBay is a project that I built in one week using React.js for the front-end.

eSBay is a mock version of the more widely known eBay - the bartering platform for second hand items.

In this version, you can create a listing and then see that listing posted inside the lists of all of the other items.

When you see the listing, there is a button that says 'Buy'. When you press that button the item is then removed from the list of potential purchases.

You can also update the information about the listing as well. If you want to change the cost or description of the item - you can with the 'Update' button.

*****IMPORTANT: When you open the front end you have to start with http://localhost:3001/login *****
It is very important that you add '/login' to the url. If you just go straight to http://localhost:3001 or http://localhost:3000 you will not see anything. You must add '/login' to either one.
